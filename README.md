I am a trainee as a merchant in e-commerce, my training lasts three years. Since I am also a hobbyist in IT, I thought I'd try to build an online shop system in the three years.
Who knows, maybe I'll need the knowledge I'm acquiring now later on in my job?
I'm taking my time with the project though, so don't expect me to work on it every day. I still have to work on the training and study for the actual exams.
Virtualizing to test everything I do with https://www.wampserver.com/en/
The project has no copyright, so if YOU find it and want to fork it or just participate do it. (IF YOU FORK, THE ONLY THINK I WANT YOU TO DO IS LINK TO THE ORIGINAL REPO ^^)
